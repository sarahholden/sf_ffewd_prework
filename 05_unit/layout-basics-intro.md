# Semantic Elements

**Semantic elements** group and organize content with descriptive names that clearly imply the purpose of the content around which they are wrapped. Structuring your HTML with semantic elements will improve your page in a number of ways:

  1) **Organization**: If you ever need to update your code, it will be easier to find the specific block that you're looking for.

  2) **Optimization**: Search engines like Google will have an easier time understanding the content on your site, making your site easier for users to find.

  3) **Accessibility**: Screen readers (devices that read the content on websites for users with vision and reading disabilities) can more easily navigate your site, making it more accessible for everyone.
